### These projects have copy right‚ù£Ô∏è


## Recommendation System in Cyber Security Prediction üçÄ
* [Network Attack path + Recommendation system to predict future attack][1]
  * Imagine the attack location is similar to movie "likes" in Netflex, and recommending future attacks is just like recommending new movies.
  * Similarly, for a client, if it has triggered a certain attack rules/signals, based on the similarity of other clients, we can predict the rules/signals that can be triggered later
* [My Project Link][2] üíñ

## Graph DB for Purchasing Anomaly Detection üçÄ
* Trying to see how to use graph DB to build purchasing behavior DB, and how efficient to find anomalies.
* [My Project Link][3] üíñ

## Silicon Valley Vancouver? üçÄ
* It seems that some sillicon valley companies are creating offices in Vancouver. I just want to observe this trend and automate this observation. Won't need much data science technique but majorly data parsing.
* [My Code][4] üíñ
  
## Bank Fantasy üå±
* I'm thinking to build my fantasy world, everything in this world has intelligence. One of the elements is a bank. 
* This bank has simplified & better oragnized data schema as real banks, and it will use AI to do something creative
* Features that use rating system can try [Bayesian Adjusted Rating][5] - It considers multiple factors in the rating rank
* Feature Ideas
  * Bridge business clients & individual clients
    * Database for business clients, individual clients, transactions, etc.
    * Based on individual client's transactions, it will recommend business clients
      * Default recommendation based on transaction info
      * Nearby recommendations with Bayesian Adjusted Rating
    * Based on individual clients' choices, trends, products relevance to provide business insights to business clients, in order to help them explore potential business opportunities.
    
## One Government System
* Design and implement a system that CRA, Canada.ca, ICBC, health care in each province, banks, etc. can talk to each other, so that when a person's immigration status changed, all the organizations will update the status.
* And when there is a new organization got added, the default cross organization communication will be added automatically.
  
## DS Collaboration Hunting Platform
* This is a platform just for people who are working on DS. People who come up with solutions and people who are look for solutions can find the opportunities of collaboration.
  * Check whether there is simiar platform first (not just DS)
  * Check whether there is NLP existing solution to match similar topics together first
  * DIY DS methods
    * Tag & entity match in NLP
    * Topic match in NLP
    * Recommendation System based on tags, topics, also will consider user feedback
      * Try [Bayesian Adjusted Rating][5]?

## Charity Project - Traveling Security Alert
  * When people are traveling, send news about massive shooting, suicide bombing news around that location
  * Predict/Forecast potential masive shooting, suicide bombing in a location that the user search (like weather forecasting)

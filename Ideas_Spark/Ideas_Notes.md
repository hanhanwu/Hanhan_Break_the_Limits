# Ideas Spark 🌟

### These projects have copy right❣️


## Recommendation System in Cyber Security Prediction 🍀
* [Network Attack path + Recommendation system to predict future attack][1]
  * Imagine the attack location is similar to movie "likes" in Netflex, and recommending future attacks is just like recommending new movies.
  * Similarly, for a client, if it has triggered a certain attack rules/signals, based on the similarity of other clients, we can predict the rules/signals that can be triggered later
* [My Project Link][2] 💖

## Graph DB for Purchasing Anomaly Detection 🍀
* Trying to see how to use graph DB to build purchasing behavior DB, and how efficient to find anomalies.
* [My Project Link][3] 💖

## Silicon Valley Vancouver? 🍀
* It seems that some sillicon valley companies are creating offices in Vancouver. I just want to observe this trend and automate this observation. Won't need much data science technique but majorly data parsing.
* [My Code][4]
  
## Bank Fantasy
* I'm thinking to build my fantasy world, everything in this world has intelligence. One of the elements is a bank. 
* This bank should have similar data structure as most banks do, and will do business in creative ways.
  * Reasearch on what kind of business banks do, that looks interesting and from there to think about more fun ideas.
  * To mimic how banks make money, how sales grow, can be interesting and challenging
* Features that use rating system can try [Bayesian Adjusted Rating] - It considers multiple factors in the rating rank
  
## Charity Project - Traveling Security Alert
  * When people are traveling, send news about massive shooting, suicide bombing news around that location
  * Predict/Forecast potential masive shooting, suicide bombing in a location that the user search (like weather forecasting)

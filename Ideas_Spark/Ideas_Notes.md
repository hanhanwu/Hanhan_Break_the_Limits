### These projects have copy right❣️


## Recommendation System in Cyber Security Prediction 🍀
* [Network Attack path + Recommendation system to predict future attack][1]
  * Imagine the attack location is similar to movie "likes" in Netflex, and recommending future attacks is just like recommending new movies.
  * Similarly, for a client, if it has triggered a certain attack rules/signals, based on the similarity of other clients, we can predict the rules/signals that can be triggered later
* [My Project Link][2] 💖

## Graph DB for Purchasing Anomaly Detection 🍀
* Trying to see how to use graph DB to build purchasing behavior DB, and how efficient to find anomalies.
* [My Project Link][3] 💖

## Silicon Valley Vancouver? 🍀
* It seems that some sillicon valley companies are creating offices in Vancouver. I just want to observe this trend and automate this observation. Won't need much data science technique but majorly data parsing.
* [My Code][4] 💖

## Sentiment Analysis on Jealousy
* Combine the analysis on both words and behaviour, to predict the probability of people's jealousy level

## Simple Words
* It's a platform like stakeflow, where people ask to explain a concept in simple words, and others answer. It supposedto be fun and helpful.
  
## Charity Project - Traveling Security Alert
  * When people are traveling, send news about massive shooting, suicide bombing news around that location
  * Predict/Forecast potential masive shooting, suicide bombing in a location that the user search (like weather forecasting)
  
## DS Collaboration Hunting Platform
* This is a platform just for people who are working on DS. People who come up with solutions and people who are look for solutions can find the opportunities of collaboration.
  * Check whether there is simiar platform first (not just DS)
  * Check whether there is NLP existing solution to match similar topics together first
  * DIY DS methods
    * Tag & entity match in NLP
    * Topic match in NLP
    * Recommendation System based on tags, topics, also will consider user feedback
      * Try [Bayesian Adjusted Rating][5]?

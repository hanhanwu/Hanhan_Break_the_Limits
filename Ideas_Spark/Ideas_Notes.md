## Recommendation System in Cyber Security Prediction
* [Network Attack path + Recommendation system to predict future attack][1]
  * Imagine the attack location is similar to movie "likes" in Netflex, and recommending future attacks is just like recommending new movies.
  * Similarly, for a client, if it has triggered a certain attack rules/signals, based on the similarity of other clients, we can predict the rules/signals that can be triggered later
  
## Charity Project - Traveling Security Alert
  * When people are traveling, send news about massive shooting, suicide bombing news around that location
  * Predict/Forecast potential masive shooting, suicide bombing in a location that the user search (like weather forecasting)

# Keystroke Mouse Behavioral Analysis

## Data Collection
Here to try difference languages to collect keystroke and mouse movement data, to compare and to find an optimal solution.
### Python Version
#### Collect Mouse Movement
* [My code - Using PyAutoGUI to record mouse movement][1]
  * [About PyAutoGUI][2]
  * It seems that the x, y collected here are all int, may lose accuracy
  * Most of the features in PyAutoGUI is to control the mouse (such as mouse up, mouse down, drag, etc.), keyboard, this can help write user behavoior simulation
  * But so far, it doesn't support more movement recording, such as mouse click
  * [My code - Mouse Movement Simulation][6]
    * <b>If something went wrong with your mouse during the experiments, press "ESC".</b>
    * [Mouse Functions Cheatsheet From pyautogui][7]
    * `moveTo` vs `dragTo`
      * When there is draggable web elements, `dragTo` can really drag things to move
    * mouse click vs `mouseDown`, `mouseUp`
      * If you want to simulate the time interval between mouse down and mouse up, the later will give you more flexibility
    * Scroll didn't show me any effect on Mac, running in IPython...
  * [My code - Keyboard Typing Simulation][8]
    * Only `typewrite()` works on IPython, functions like `keyDown()`, `keyUp()` you need to use terminal to see the output
    * Keys such as "shift" won't work on Mac, but works on Windows...
      * To install pyautogui on Windows, you just need to type `pip install pyautogui` if you have installed Anaconda Python3 and added pip into your path
    * [pyautogui keys - only works on windows][9]
    * [keyboard functions][10]
* [Pynput for mouse monitoring][3]
  * Not sure why, I used IPython and python terminal, none of them could give me any output...
  
### jQuery Version
Although I'm very bad at JS, jQuery is really great to record all these movements with high precision.
* [My code - Single field keystroke & mouse movement][4]
  * It records mouse movement, mouse enter, mouse leave, mouse down, mouse up, key down and key up.
  * The data details are recorded in console, save console results into .txt file should be fine
  * Besides output the data in the console, in the code, it also pushes each keystroke (key up & key down) into a list `tmr`. There are a few interesting findings:
    * If you press "Enter" to trigger the button, its keyup won't be recorded in the `tmr` list, but will appear in console. So better to use console to record the data you want to collect.
    * If you typed any special character, such as `&` = Shift + 7, if you simply record the event key, it will record "Shift" and "&", while the code for "&" and "7" are the same. So, it's better to record the event code or both, otherwise same key maybe recorded as different when you used Shift
  * For mouse movement
    * The jQuery selector `$('*')` will record all the mouse movement when you on moving on the whole page, `$(document.body)` only works around your web form, a very small area.
    * Find all the mouse events that jQuery supports [here][5]
    * All the (x,y) are integers
    * When pressed "Enter" to trigger the submit button, absolute (x,y) will be (0,0), relative (x,y) won't. <b>Better to use absolute (x,y) to record mouse movement</b>. When you really use mouse to click the submit button, the absolute (x,y) won't be (0,0)
    * Also, if you typed "Enter" to trigger submit button, there won't be mouseenter, mousedown, mouseup or mouseleave recorded. Only when you are really using the mouse, these will be recorded.

# Attack Signals Recommendation System


## Potential Data Source
* [KDD 99 attacks][1]
  * The attack types can serve as signals
  * This data has focus more on "user" data - the features, but the types of attack are limited
  * Testing data has new type of attacks that never appeared in training data, which can be interesting
  
  
## Potential Delight User Points
* New types of attacks that never appeared in any existing "user" records, is that possible to detect?

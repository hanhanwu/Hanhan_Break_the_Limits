## [Prototype]
* [Click Me ‚ù£][1]

## Implementation
### Data Preprocessing
* `merchant_order.pkl` - Merchant Order table
  * It records detailed orders for each merchant
* `merchant_product.pkl` - Merchant Product table
  * It records the products selled by each merchant
* `ts_purchase.pkl` - Time Series table
  * It records daily purchase $ and clients amount for each merchant, used for later time series analysis, forecasting
* NOTE: Because of the limitation from online grocery data, there is some mockup data generated using monte carlo simulation. Such as merchant, price, purchase date. For the purpose of simplification, it also assume the sales prices for the same products is the same for each merchant.
* [My Code][2]üíñ

### Forecasting Preparation
* The main purpose of this section is to prepare for representative sample data, and choose a forecasting method that can be shared by the merchants.
* [My Code - Preparing for the sample datasets][3]üíñ
  * The 2 samples are representative to show 2 major types of time series curves.
  * "client_count" and "purchase_amount" are showing almost the same pattern in the curves. So in the forecasting experiemnts below, I will just use one of them.


## Future Workd
* Choose different forecasting method automatically for each merchant?

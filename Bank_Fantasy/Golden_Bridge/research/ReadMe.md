# Research Notes

## User Behavior for Rating System
* [An Analysis of Mobile Banking User Behavior Using Customer Segmentation][2]
  * Customer loyalty -> how many returned customer -> merchant's rating
  * I like the mention of RFM customer behaviour characteristics
    * Recency: The interval between the purchase and the time of analysis.
    * Frequency: The number of purchases within a certain period.
    * Monetary: The amount of money spent during a certain period.
  * Agree with the idea of customer segmentation
  * But for other personal data used for customer segmenattion, it might break many banks privacy policy I think

## Bayesian Adjusted Rating
* [How to use bayesian adjusted rating in star system][1]
  * Star system is a system used for rating with stars, commonly using 5 stars
  * Python example

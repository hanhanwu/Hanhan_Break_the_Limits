# Research Notes

## User Behavior for Rating System
* [An Analysis of Mobile Banking User Behavior Using Customer Segmentation][2]
  * Customer loyalty -> how many returned customer -> merchant's rating
  * I like the mention of RFM customer behaviour characteristics
    * Recency: The interval between the purchase and the time of analysis.
    * Frequency: The number of purchases within a certain period.
    * Monetary: The amount of money spent during a certain period.
  * Agree with the idea of customer segmentation
  * But for other personal data used for customer segmenattion, it might break many banks privacy policy I think
  
## How to Calculate Rating Score
* [Distance to perfect score][3]
  * It uses the perfect score minus the distance between current point and the perfect score
  * Support multiple variables
* [Knowing max and benchmark][4]
  * When you know the max numerical values of each variable and the star rating benchmark (max value)
